#Directions file!
This will be a good place to start if you know how to code, but aren't sure where to start.

###Change color scheme
To do this you need follow this path, realitive to here `../sass/main.scss` once you go there, you will see coloring up at the top that you can change. That will change the color scheme for the whole website. Change at your own risk!

###Change break points
This is the exact same spot you need to go to change the color scheme `../sass/main.scss`. You will go to the top and look at the top to see `$mobile:`, `$tablet:` and `$max-width:`. If you change any of those, you will change the break points for the whole site.
